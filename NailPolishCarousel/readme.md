## Nail Polish Carousel
#### Carousel for storing nail polish bottles, each carousel section holds 7 bottles and the top static section holds a further 3. Designed around the dimensions of an OPI bottle.

Rotating segments are keyed - hex key with 7 bottles per section means you can have segments aligned vertically or a gentle sprial.

##### Files:
